## 🔍 1. Project Overview

A machine learning-powered system that predicts **hardware failures** in industrial machines by analyzing sensor and status data.

### 🎯 Objective
> **Detect and classify failure risks before they occur** using historical sensor patterns and persistent ML models.

### ✅ Key Features
- Predicts **5 types of hardware failures**: Hard Disk, Fan, Power Supply, Network Card, Motherboard
- Forecasts **time-to-failure** and **failure probability**
- Uses **persistent models** — trains once, reuses across runs
- Fully **automated & dynamic** — no hardcoded values
- Built for **real-world deployment**

## 🧠 4. Machine Learning Approach

### 📌 Problem Type
- **Multi-Scenario Binary Classification**
  - One model per failure type
  - Target: Will `X` failure occur in the next 3 minutes?

### 🧰 Algorithms Used
| Task | Model |
|------|-------|
| Failure Risk Prediction | `RandomForestClassifier` |
| Time to Failure (regression) | `RandomForestRegressor` (optional) |
| Anomaly Detection | Isolation Forest (future) |

### 📈 Why Random Forest?
- Handles mixed data (numeric + categorical)
- Resistant to overfitting
- Interpretable feature importance
- Works well on small-to-medium datasets

---

## 🧩 5. Key Features Engineered

| Feature | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| `temperature_rolling_avg` | Detect gradual overheating |
| `temp_fan_ratio` | Identify cooling inefficiency |
| `current_pressure_ratio` | Detect power stress |
| `vibration_temp_interaction` | Mechanical wear indicator |
| `hour`, `minute` | Capture time-of-day effects |

> These features help distinguish between **similar-looking failures** (e.g., fan vs. hard disk).

---

## 🔁 6. Model Persistence & Reuse

### 💾 What Is Saved?
| Artifact | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Trained Models | `models/*.pkl` | Reuse without retraining |
| Label Encoders | `encoders/*.pkl` | Consistent encoding |
| Latest Data | `machine_sensor_data.csv` | State continuity |

### 🔄 Behavior Across Runs
| Run | Action |
|-----|--------|
| First Run | Trains all models, saves to disk |
| Subsequent Runs | Loads saved models, skips training |
| `FORCE_RETRAIN=True` | Retrains with new data |

✅ **No redundant computation**  
✅ **Fast startup**  
✅ **Ready for automation**

## 📈 7. Output: Real-Time Risk Forecast

### 🚨 Sample Output
```
🚨 FAILURE RISK FORECAST

Machine  Risk Type          Level      Confidence   Indicators
---------------------------------------------------------------
101      🔧 Hard Disk        🔴 High    94.0%     High Temp; High Vib
102      🌀 Fan              🔴 High    96.0%     High Temp; Low Fan
103      ⚡ Power Supply      🟡 Medium  65.0%     High Current; Warning
104      ✅ None             🟢 Low     0.0%      None
```

### 📣 Interpretable Alerts
Each prediction includes:
- **Failure type icon and name**
- **Risk level** (High/Medium/Low)
- **Confidence score**
- **Observed indicators** (e.g., high temp, low fan)

## 🛡️ 8. Edge Case Handling

| Challenge | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Rare failures (only 1 sample) | Skip model training, fallback to 0 risk |
| `predict_proba()` shape error | Check `proba.shape[1]` before access |
| Unseen categorical labels | Reuse saved encoders only on known values |
| Single-class training data | Validate `y_train.nunique() >= 2` |

> Ensures **robustness** in production environments.

## 🚀 9. Future Enhancements

| Feature | Benefit |
|-------|--------|
| **Streamlit Dashboard** | Visualize risk over time |
| **Email/SMS Alerts** | Notify engineers in real time |
| **Incremental Learning** | Update models with new data |
| **Failure Probability Over Time** | Project risk curve |
